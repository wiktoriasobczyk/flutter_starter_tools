## ðŸ›  FVM Configuration 

**FVM** stands for Flutter Version Management. It's a tool that simplifies the process of switching between different Flutter versions in your projects. Let's get it set up:

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can find the installation steps [here](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).

### Installation Steps

2. **Install FVM via Homebrew**:
    ```bash
    brew tap leoafarias/fvm
    brew install fvm
    ```

3. **Check Available Flutter Versions**:
    ```bash
    fvm releases
    ```

4. **Install Desired Flutter Version**: You can choose to install the stable version or any specific version:
    ```bash
    fvm install stable
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    fvm install 3.10.6
    ```

5. **Activate Flutter Version for Your Project**: Navigate to your project directory and set the version:
    ```bash
    fvm use stable
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    fvm use 3.10.6
    ```

6. **Update `.gitignore` File**: Ensure that Flutter version-specific files aren't accidentally committed to your version control.

7. **Using Flutter Commands with FVM**: All traditional Flutter commands can be prefixed with `fvm`:
    ```bash
    fvm flutter run
    ```
